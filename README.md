# PythonProjectCoursera
This is my first Python Project for the Coursera Certification Course and I have uploaded the project here on GitHub to assess the same.
The project aims to extract data from an API and by webscraping a given site to find the share prices and revenues of 'Tesla' and 'GameStop'.
